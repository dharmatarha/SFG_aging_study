# SFG_aging_study
Code for an ongoing research project (*"Testing aging deficits in auditory object perception"*). SFG stands for Stochastic Figure-Ground, a type 

The study relies on [Psychtoolbox](https://psychtoolbox.org/) for stimulus generation/presentation and so related code is written in Matlab (developed with 2017a). Octave compatibility is not tested.

Functions in /stimulus are used for stimulus generation, functions in /presentation for stimulus presentation and recording responses. 

Code is free to all (MIT license) but please cite earlier work by the group:
